This is a new plugin that gives you a button of your choice that goes to the top of the page .

== Description ==
The 'GoToTheTop' plugin automatically adds a customizable button to your website, allowing users to quickly scroll back to the top of the page. With this plugin, you can insert a "Back to Top" button and personalize its appearance, including its color, shape, padding, and width, positioning it in any corner of the page you prefer.

Additionally, the plugin allows you to choose from a variety of icons provided by 'GoToTheTop'. You can even upload a custom image by simply entering its URL.

To use this plugin, simply download the folder, replace it in the plugins directory of your WordPress installation, and activate it. Once activated, you’ll find a new “GoToTheTop Settings” option in the WordPress settings menu, where you can customize and enable your button.

Don’t forget to share your feedback—I’d love to hear your thoughts!
